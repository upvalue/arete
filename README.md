Arete is an implementation of the Scheme programming language in C++ and itself.

# Why?

Arete was written mostly for fun. I also made it as a platform for experimenting with more radical programming language
design and implementation, but for the moment it's essentially a vanilla Scheme. 

# Dependencies

Arete uses the C++ STL, and optionally the linenoise-ng library from ArangoDB.

# R?RS/SRFI compliance.

Arete currently aims at R5RS compliance minus continuations. It is probable that R7RS modules will be added in the near
future.
