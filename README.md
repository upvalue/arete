# Arete Scheme

Arete is a simple, embeddable Scheme interpreter in C++. It's written with the following goals in mind:

- Cross-platform
- Distills down to two files for ease of inclusion in other projects
- Incremental garbage collector and speed suitable for writing games
- Hygienic macros and modules
- Highly practical feature set (type-checking, generics and methods)

But mostly just for fun!
