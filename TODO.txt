runtime
- figure out how to get a stack trace with C++ after type errors
- hash tables
- ports

- better handling of large allocations
x semispace garbage collection for extreme debugging and robustness
- could semispace collector also be used to optionally compact the incremental collector?
interpreter
- let
x naming lambdas
- stack traces
reader
- expression comments #;
- block comments #|
- extended symbols |
- utf8
- attach source code info to symbols by boxing them
